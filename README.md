# First-Backend
My first backend work- php and mySQL

I always heard of mongoDB and express as preffered backend tools and also rumours of php going obselete...
but I was very stunned by its devlopment experience especially in smaller scale application like this one

take a peek into my User Feedback Form of my Portfolio website made with old school combo of php and mySQL
going to explore more interesting sides of php

HAPPY CODING!!!
