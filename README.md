# First-Backend
My first backend work- php and mySQL

I always heard og mongoDB and express as preffered backend tools and also rumours of php going obselete...
but I was very much satisfied by its devlopment experience especially in smaller scale application like this one

going to explore more interesting sides of php

HAPPY CODING!!!
